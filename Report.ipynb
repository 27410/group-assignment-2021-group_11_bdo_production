    "### 1.1 Literature review of the compound\n",
    "1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) is a four-carbon compound with two hydroxyl groups. At room temperature, it appears as a colorless and viscous liquid, with a melting point of ~230ºC and high water solubility. The typical commercial purity requirements are 99.5-99.8% (Elvers, 2003).   \n",
    "\n",
    "1,4-BDO has a large number of applications in the petrochemical industry including the production of tetrahydrofuran (THF), an intermediate for spandex, and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) resins for thermoplastic fabrication. In addition, 1,4-BDO is needed for the synthesis of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), as well as polyesters and polyurethanes (Silva, 2020). Finally, it is also employed as a pest control and growth-promoting agent in agriculture, mainly due to its high biodegradability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1,4-BDO market is in the process of expanding, sitting at an estimated 6 billion value in 2018 but projected to reach over 12 billion in 2025 (1,4-BDO market size, n.d.). Global production amounts to around 2 million MT/yr, with a sale price of roughly 2\\\\$/kg. Bio-based production represents a very small fraction of the BDO market, which is mostly dominated by chemical manufacturing from petroleum-based feedstocks. However, techno-economical analyses have shown that the bioproduction of BDO could lower its price down to 1.8$/kg (Satam, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "No known microorganisms have been identified to naturally synthesize 1,4-BDO, but the heterologous expression in E coli is a well-established process that has been improved from production titers of 20 g/L in the early strains to more than 125 g/L in the latest (Satam, 2019, Yim, 2011) in process. These advances were achieved through metabolic engineering and biochemical pathway optimization (Burgard, 2016).\n",

    "### 1.2 Literature review of the cell factory (<500 words) \n",
    "*E. coli* is one of the best studied hosts used as cell factories. It has a high growth rate, compared to most microorganisms, and its physiology, biochemistry and genetics are extensively characterized. *E. coli* is the most used microorganism in research laboratories with much experience having been gathered around engineering its genome. Several genetic tools have been developed for engineering this goal, resulting in a big number of different industrial *E. coli* strains, that can be deployed to produce proteins and molecules of interest. The most commonly used *E. coli* strains have a GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status and are easily culturable, adding up more reason why *E. coli* is the most preferred bacterial microorganism for applications in research and industrial environments (Pontrelli, 2018). \n",
    "The biggest limitation in the use of *E. coli* as a cell factory comes to the production of eukaryotic proteins, since the needed protein modifications cannot be performed in prokaryotic cells (Theisen, 2017). Additionally, as all prokaryotic systems, *E. coli* is sensitive to bacteriophage contamination, a problem which Liu, L., Zhao, D., Ye, L. et al. tried to address by constructing a phage-resistance system in *E. coli* BL21, one of the most popular industrial *E. coli* strains (Liu, 2020). Formation of inclusion bodies is another disadvantage of *E. coli* in industrial applications, but various methods have been developed for the renaturation of the proteins in these insoluble aggregates (Theisen, 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### E. coli for 1,4 BDO production \n",
    "1,4-BDO is not naturally produced by *E. coli*. Several groups have engineered *E. coli* to produce 1,4-BDO, deploying different pathways, with two being the most sufficient and starting from succinate and α-ketoglutarate accordingly. However, the insertion of metabolic pathways for the production of 1,4-BDO does not lead to high titers of the product. Therefore, research groups have tried various approaches to optimize the production process. Research efforts have focused on increasing the production of precursor molecules, suppressing competing genes that direct the carbon flow towards the production of byproducts and testing different carbon sources, among others. Overall, *E. coli* is considered an ideal host for production of 1,4-BDO, for reasons stated above. \n",
    " \n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, no other microorganism has been engineered to produce 1,4-BDO. This shows that engineering microorganisms for the production of this compound can be quite challenging. The main reason for this seems to be its highly reduced nature (Yim et al., 2011)."

    "It can be challenging to produce bulk compounds using a metabolically modified *E. coli* strain. For example, it has been noted throughout time that the output of non-natural chemicals such as 1,4-BDO requires a new synthetic pathway every time, despite the fact that 1,4-BDO is a reduced material, which necessitates more oxidoreduction processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent investigations targeted at producing 1,4-BDO from raw materials such as sugar, dextrose (undirect production) (Burgard, 2016), and direct production (Yim, 2011) have found that the yield achieves roughly 70% of the theoretical estimate (Tai, 2016) and a production of 18.  g/L, respectively.  \n",

    "The GSMs of *E. Coli* strain K-12 MG165 that can be found in the literature and can be used to simulate the production of 1,4-BDO, vary. The existing models which are being compared are the iML1515, iJO1366 and iAF1260 (Monk, 2017, Orth, 2011, Feist, 2011). These three models are the latest and all of them consist of a great number of genes, reactions and metabolites. More specifically, the first includes 2712 metabolic reactions, 1877 metabolites and knowledge of 1515 proteins can be extract from its database, whereas the second model provides information for 2583 reactions and 1805 metabolites, while the third one, that’s also the older one of the investigated models, consists of 2382 reactions and 1668 metabolites. There is a significant difference in the numbers of those models and the reason is that iML1515 is an updated version of both iJO1366 and iAF1260. The iML1515 model was constructed based on the iJO1366 by adding 149 new genes and 129 new reactions. It is considered to be the most complete genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic network in this particular strain of *E. Coli*. The previous update of this model was in 2011 and since then new functions and competences have been discovered and added. The knowledge that can be obtained from the model is abundant consequently, it is being chosen to be the GSMs for the optimization of the 1,4-BDO pathway.\n",

    "It can be concluded that this model will be able to provide with reliable predictions as a more up to date model. According to publications it is capable enough to predict the growth effect of gene knockouts. These predictions were validated experimentally via genome-wide gene-knockout screens with 3892 gene knockouts and with 16 different carbon substrates. The results that were extracted, gave an accuracy of 93.4% compared to previous iJO1366 models’ accuracy which was 89.8%. The fact that this model has many more gene, reactions and metabolites than all the other models, increases the number of false-positive predictions made which results in an increased accuracy.\n",

Then, our computations indicate that semi-aerobic conditions are the ideal conditions regarding oxygen, leading to higher 1,4-BDO production.  Ethanol, as a cheap and widely-used compound in industrial applications, as a carbon source seems to yield one of the highest 1,4-BDO production, while achieving growth rate in high levels as well.

    "To construct SUCD model six heterologous reaction steps of production of 1,4-BDO from succinate were added, resulting in yield of 0.9606 p-mmol/gl-mmol, while to construct AKG model, five steps were added, the 1,4-BDO production starting from α-ketoglutarate with yield of 0,97081 p-mmol/gl-mmol. Both heterologous pathways introduced here contain several reduction steps and require energy, while at the same time reducing the flux through TCA cycle, further depleting cell energy levels. These conditions might be the reason for higher production levels of 1,4-BDO in semi-aerobic conditions, since more ATP is generated through the respiration. In latest 1,4-BDO production model published (Burgard et al., 2016) the redirection of TCA cycle, balancing of ATP and redox reactions and strategic deletions aimed to reduce byproducts were included, which are not in scope of this project, and probable reason for dicrepancy between our and published results, beyond the fact that they used different E.coli model (MG 1655). Moreover, export of 1,4-BDO from the cell was not addressed in the article, but inclusion of membrane proteins in the model has potential to increase yield with possible higher transport efficiency, providing a interesting target for the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation during the carbon sources analysis was that by changing the substrate to a different compound but keeping it to the same concentration, the model can benefit and give better yields. Considering the availability and the price of each substrate, the model can be optimized by changing the glucose.\n",
    "Additionaly, it was shown that the model can also produce the compound of interest while being under anaerobic conditions. However, the yield is better when the model works aerobically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our attempt to optimize the production of 1,4-BDO in both our models, we manually knocked out some genes. As mentioned above, these genes were identified by literature review and were encoding a malate dehydrogenase (mdh), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE) and pyruvate formate lyase (pfl). Deleting those genes did not affect the 1,4-BDO production rate, \n",
    "\n",
    "We then used two optimization algorithms, OptGene and OptKnock. OptGene did not give any results, while OptKnock resulted in some reaction knockouts that were tested and found to not affect the production of 1,4-BDO.This could be explained if there are no reactions inhibiting the 1,4-BDO production pathway. Another explanation could be the use of a different model than our reference in literature.\n",
    "In future work, we could try to run OptGene under different conditions, e.g. different carbon sources or optimized production pathway. OptKnock could run under anaerobic conditions or with utilizing different carbon sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy we tried is co-factor swapping.However, no results were returned in this step as well. This could potentially mean that the 1,4-BDO production pathways do not use special co-factors and swapping them with different ones would not result in higher yield. Investigating the co-factors' concentrations on each stage is a different approach of co-factor swap that could be pursued, where we could analyze the concentrations of our response variables on both SUCD and AKG models at the same time. \n",

    "E.coli model iML1515 was used to introduce two heterologous pathways for production of 1,4-BDO, producing model SUCD and model AKG which were visualized in Escher. To increase production several analyses were conducted: medium optimization, OptGene and OptKnock, co-factor swap, FSEOF and phenotypic phase plane analysis. We have found that OptGene, OptKnock and co-factor swap analysis did not yield significant results. PPP analysis showed peculiarity: too high oxygen concentration inhibits 1,4-BDO production, a fact not included in published data. Medium analysis showed several promising options (such as ethanol), while FSEOF analysis yielded perplexing results which do not fit with model characteristics and are thus discarded. Overall models did not differ much, as expected due to may shared reactions, but AKG model showed slightly better results, which might be due to less heterologous reactions implemented. The model with best performance would be an AKG model that grows in semi-aerobic conditions on ethanol. "
