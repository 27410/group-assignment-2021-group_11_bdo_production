    "### 1.1 Literature review of the compound (<500 words)\n",
    "1,4-butanediol (BDO) is a four-carbon compound with two hydroxyl groups. At room temperature, it appears as a colorless and viscous liquid, with a melting point of ~230ºC and high water solubility. The typical commercial purity requirements are 99.5-99.8% (Elvers, 2003).   \n",
    "\n",
    "BDO has a large number of applications in the petrochemical industry including the production of tetrahydrofuran (THF), an intermediate for spandex, and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) resins for thermoplastic fabrication. In addition, BDO is needed for the synthesis of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), as well as polyesters and polyurethanes (Silva, 2020). Finally, it is also employed as a pest control and growth-promoting agent in agriculture, mainly due to its high biodegradability.\n",
    "\n",
    "BDO market is in the process of expanding, sitting at an estimated 6 billion value in 2018 but projected to reach over 12 billion in 2025 (1,4 butanediol market size, n.d.). Global production amounts to around 2 million MT/yr, with a sale price of roughly 2\\\\$/kg. Bio-based production represents a very small fraction of the BDO market, which is mostly dominated by chemical manufacturing from petroleum-based feedstocks. However, techno-economical analyses have shown that the bioproduction of BDO could lower its price down to 1.8$/kg (Satam, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "No known microorganisms have been identified to naturally synthesize BDO, but the heterologous expression in E coli is a well-established process that has been improved from production titers of 20 g/L in the early strains to more than 125 g/L in the latest (Satam, 2019, Yim, 2011) in process. These advances were achieved through metabolic engineering and biochemical pathway optimization (Burgard, 2016).\n",

    "### 1.2 Literature review of the cell factory (<500 words) \n",
    "*E. coli* is one of the best studied hosts used as cell factories. It has a high growth rate, compared to most microorganisms, and its physiology, biochemistry and genetics are extensively characterized. *E. coli* is the most used microorganism in research laboratories with much experience having been gathered around engineering its genome. Several genetic tools have been developed for engineering this goal, resulting in a big number of different industrial *E. coli* strains, that can be deployed to produce proteins and molecules of interest. The most commonly used *E. coli* strains have a GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status and are easily culturable, adding up more reason why *E. coli* is the most preferred bacterial microorganism for applications in research and industrial environments (Pontrelli, 2018). \n",
    "The biggest limitation in the use of *E. coli* as a cell factory comes to the production of eukaryotic proteins, since the needed protein modifications cannot be performed in prokaryotic cells (Theisen, 2017). Additionally, as all prokaryotic systems, *E. coli* is sensitive to bacteriophage contamination, a problem which Liu, L., Zhao, D., Ye, L. et al. tried to address by constructing a phage-resistance system in *E. coli* BL21, one of the most popular industrial *E. coli* strains (Liu, 2020). Formation of inclusion bodies is another disadvantage of *E. coli* in industrial applications, but various methods have been developed for the renaturation of the proteins in these insoluble aggregates (Theisen, 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### E. coli for 1,4 BDO production \n",
    "1,4-BDO is not naturally produced by *E. coli*. Several groups have engineered *E. coli* to produce 1,4-BDO, deploying different pathways, with two being the most sufficient and starting from succinate and α-ketoglutarate accordingly. However, the insertion of metabolic pathways for the production of 1,4-BDO does not lead to high titers of the product. Therefore, research groups have tried various approaches to optimize the production process. Research efforts have focused on increasing the production of precursor molecules, suppressing competing genes that direct the carbon flow towards the production of byproducts and testing different carbon sources, among others. Overall, *E. coli* is considered an ideal host for production of 1,4-BDO, for reasons stated above. \n",
    " \n",
    "*Vibrio natriegens* has also been engineered and used for the production of BDO achieving higher BDO production rates compared to the rates achieved from *E. coli* (Erian, 2020). *V. natriegens* is a gram-negative marine bacterium with well characterized genetics that has been engineered for various biotechnological applications (Weinstock, 2016). This bacterium has been reported to be the fastest growing organism with a duplication time of less than 10 minutes. Unlike *E. coli*, *V. natriegens* is cold-sensitive, probably due to low catalase activity, making its storage more challenging (Schleicher, 2018). Moreover, its high growth rate could be a potential disadvantage for commercial bioproduction processes, since bacterial biomass yield has been shown to be optimal in intervening growth rate, due to a negative relationship between yield and growth rate (Lipson, 2015).

    "## 2. Problem definition (<300 words)\n",
    "The production of bulk chemicals through a metabolic engineered *E. coli* strain can be quite challenging. For example, during the years, it has been observed that the output of non-natural substances such as 1,4-butanediol (BDO) requires every time a new synthetic pathway, while increased oxidoreduction reactions have to take place since 1,4-butanediol is a reduced substance. Although, it should be mentioned that many byproducts are emitted during the production of BDO in the TCA cycle, which can affect its final titer. Thus, it is needed to resort to methods of dealing with or eliminating them to improve the quality and increase the quantity of the final product. \n",
    " \n",
    "Recent studies which have aimed to produce BDO through raw materials such as sugar, dextrose (undirect production) (Burgard, 2016), and direct production (Yim, 2011)  have shown that the yield reaches approximately the 70% of the theoretical estimation (Tai, 2016) and a production of 18 g/L, respectively.  \n",
    " \n",
    "One of the major challenges that arise during the BDO’s production is the emission of CO2. By having the largest percentage among other byproducts. This project aims to increase the BDO’s titer and concurrently minimize the emissions of the byproducts that affect the final output.  \n"

    "The GSMs of *E. Coli* strain K-12 MG165 that can be found in the literature and can be used to simulate the production of 1,4 butanediol, vary. The existing models which are being compared are the iML1515, iJO1366 and iAF1260 (Monk, 2017, Orth, 2011, Feist, 2011). These three models are the latest and all of them consist of a great number of genes, reactions and metabolites. More specifically, the first includes 2712 metabolic reactions, 1877 metabolites and knowledge of 1515 proteins can be extract from its database, whereas the second model provides information for 2583 reactions and 1805 metabolites, while the third one, that’s also the older one of the investigated models, consists of 2382 reactions and 1668 metabolites. There is a significant difference in the numbers of those models and the reason is that iML1515 is an updated version of both iJO1366 and iAF1260. The iML1515 model was constructed based on the iJO1366 by adding 149 new genes and 129 new reactions. It is considered to be the most complete genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic network in this particular strain of *E. Coli*. The previous update of this model was in 2011 and since then new functions and competences have been discovered and added. The knowledge that can be obtained from the model is abundant consequently, it is being chosen to be the GSMs for the optimization of the 1,4 butanediol pathway.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be concluded that this model will be able to provide with reliable predictions as a more up to date model. According to publications it is capable enough to predict the growth effect of gene knockouts. These predictions were validated experimentally via genome-wide gene-knockout screens with 3892 gene knockouts and with 16 different carbon substrates. The results that were extracted, gave an accuracy of 93.4% compared to previous iJO1366 models’ accuracy which was 89.8%. The fact that this model has many more gene, reactions and metabolites than all the other models, increases the number of false-positive predictions made which results in an increased accuracy.\n",
